## Technical Details

### Responsive Breakpoints Used
- `sm:` - 640px and up (small tablets and up)
- `lg:` - 1024px and up (desktop)
- Mobile-first approach with base styles for mobile

### Key Responsive Patterns Applied
1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Base styles for mobile, enhanced for larger screens
2. **Content Prioritization**: Hide non-essential elements on mobile
3. **Touch-Friendly Sizing**: Minimum 44px touch targets
4. **Flexible Layouts**: Use of flexbox and grid with responsive gaps
5. **Scalable Typography**: Responsive text sizes using Tailwind's responsive prefixes

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced animation durations on mobile
- Optimized touch scrolling
- Minimized layout shifts with proper sizing
- Efficient use of CSS transforms and transitions

## Testing Recommendations

### Mobile Devices to Test
- iPhone SE (375px width)
- iPhone 12/13/14 (390px width)
- Samsung Galaxy S21 (360px width)
- iPad Mini (768px width)

### Key Areas to Verify
1. **Touch Targets**: All buttons and interactive elements are easily tappable
2. **Text Readability**: All text is legible without zooming
3. **Layout Integrity**: No horizontal scrolling or overflow
4. **Performance**: Smooth animations and transitions
5. **Functionality**: All features work correctly on touch devices

## Browser Compatibility
- iOS Safari 14+
- Chrome Mobile 90+
- Samsung Internet 14+
- Firefox Mobile 90+

## Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing swipe gestures for navigation
2. Add pull-to-refresh functionality
3. Optimize images for different screen densities
4. Implement progressive web app features
5. Add haptic feedback for touch interactions
