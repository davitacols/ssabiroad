The JSX error is on line 1251 where there's a mismatch between opening <Animated.View> and closing </View> tags.

The issue is in the tips section around line 1247-1251. The opening tag is:
<Animated.View style={[styles.tipsContainer, { backgroundColor: theme.surface }]}>

But the closing tag is:
</View>

It should be:
</Animated.View>

To fix this, change the closing </View> tag to </Animated.View> to match the opening tag.
