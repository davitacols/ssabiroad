JSX Tag Mismatch Fix Instructions:

The error is on line 1251 where there's an <Animated.View> opening tag that's being closed with </View> instead of </Animated.View>.

To fix this:
1. Find the tips section around line 1251
2. Look for the pattern where showTips && ( opens an <Animated.View>
3. Change the closing </View> to </Animated.View> to match the opening tag

The specific line that needs to be changed is around line 1251 where it says:
              </View>
            )}

It should be changed to:
              </Animated.View>
            )}

This will resolve the JSX syntax error.
