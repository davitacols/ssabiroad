```
This video demonstrates how Pic2Nav uses permissions:

PHOTO ACCESS: Extract GPS coordinates from EXIF metadata and analyze building features for location identification (core functionality).

CAMERA ACCESS: Capture photos with location data for instant analysis.

LOCATION ACCESS: Match GPS coordinates to real-world addresses and show nearby places.

FOREGROUND SERVICE (OPTIONAL): Only used for geofence alerts feature. Users must manually enable this. A persistent notification is shown when active, and users can disable it anytime from settings or notification.

The foreground service is NOT required for core functionality - photo location analysis works without it.
