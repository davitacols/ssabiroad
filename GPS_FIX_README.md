# GPS Data Preservation Fix

## Problem
Image uploads from gallery were not preserving GPS data, causing location detection to fail for photos with embedded GPS coordinates.

## Solution
Updated both mobile app and server-side code to properly extract and handle GPS data from images.

### Mobile App Changes (`mobile-fixed/App.js`)

1. **Enhanced GPS Extraction**: Added comprehensive GPS data extraction that handles multiple EXIF formats:
   - Direct GPS coordinates (`GPSLatitude`, `GPSLongitude`)
   - GPS info object (`GPS.GPSLatitude`, `GPS.GPSLongitude`)
   - iOS location format (`location.latitude`, `location.longitude`)

2. **Better Validation**: Added proper coordinate validation:
   - Type checking (must be numbers)
   - Range validation (lat: -90 to 90, lng: -180 to 180)
   - Non-zero validation

3. **Fallback Location**: If no GPS data is found in image, attempts to get current location as fallback

4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to debug GPS extraction issues

### Server-Side Changes (`app/api/location-recognition/route.ts`)

1. **Improved EXIF Processing**: Enhanced server-side EXIF extraction with:
   - Better GPS coordinate validation
   - GPS reference direction handling (N/S, E/W)
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **GPS Reference Support**: Properly handles GPS reference directions to ensure correct coordinate signs

### Utilities (`mobile-fixed/utils/gpsUtils.js`)

Created reusable GPS utilities for:
- GPS coordinate extraction
- GPS data validation
- GPS data debugging and summary

## Testing
To test GPS preservation:

1. Take a photo with GPS enabled or use an existing photo with GPS data
2. Upload from gallery in the mobile app
3. Check console logs for GPS extraction details
4. Verify location is detected correctly

## Key Features
- ✅ Preserves GPS data from gallery images
- ✅ Handles multiple EXIF GPS formats
- ✅ Validates GPS coordinates properly
- ✅ Falls back to current location if no GPS data
- ✅ Enhanced debugging and logging
- ✅ Works with both camera captures and gallery selections

## Usage
The fix is automatically applied when using the image picker in the mobile app. No additional configuration needed.
